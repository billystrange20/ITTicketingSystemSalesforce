# IT Ticketing System in Salesforce

This is a demo of my IT ticketing system I created using Salesforce for my company Burman Recruitment! [Click here to watch](https://github.com/billystrange20/ITTicketingSystemSalesforce/blob/main/IT%20Ticketing%20System%20Demo.mp4) 

A user will submit a ticket via the Home page on the app, and IT support will recieve an email for the newly created ticket. When moved to ongoing by IT support, an email to the ticket creator will be sent to them informing them of the status change. A final email will be sent when status has changed to completed, also updating the completed date field.

I have also created a dashboard for the IT support to view relevant reports on the tickets that come through the system.
